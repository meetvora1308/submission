1. In this project I have create a Login and Register user api and register api

url for Login user: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login_user/ method : POST
url for Register user : http://127.0.0.1:8000/register_user/ method : POST

2. I had made one assumption that user can edit update and delete address which user has only created :

Details for model/Table that we have used is latitude, longtitude, address

list of all address : http://127.0.0.1:8000/address/ method: GET
list of create address : http://127.0.0.1:8000/address/ method: POST
list of update a address : http://127.0.0.1:8000/address/{id} method: Patch
list of delete a address : http://127.0.0.1:8000/address/{id} method: DELETE

3. for search nearby it address I have used input parameter as latitude and longitude as a input parameter then it will find out address nearby 1.609 miles which we can modify

search address : http://127.0.0.1:8000/address/ method = POST
